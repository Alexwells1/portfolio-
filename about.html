            <h3>Hello there ðŸ‘‹,</h3>
           <div>
                <p>Friends call me mikun, but my name is Egbetola Ayomikun. As a UI/UX designer, I am passionate about creating fluid and captivating digital experiences. I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in the Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta(FUNAAB) and will graduate in 2026.</p>         

                <p> passion has always been creating user-friendly and intuitive interfaces, and I enjoy using wireframing, prototyping, and research to make ideas a reality. I try to make products that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also simple to use because I think that great design is a balance of technology, usability, and aesthetics.</p> 
                
               <p>I like working on a range of projects that push the limits of user experience, from web platforms to mobile apps. My objective is to solve practical issues, design with empathy, and improve digital interactions. </p>
                <br>
                <p>When Iâ€™m not behind my Laptop, youâ€™ll probably find me playing video games; Call of Duty Mobile and Mobile Legends: Bang Bang are my favorites, as they challenge me to strategize and think ahead. I also enjoy reading novels when I want to unwind.</p>

                <h1>Design</h1>
                <p>I might not be the designer sketching wireframes in a notebook, but I design. Youâ€™ll find me weaving grids, aligning components, and fine-tuning interactionsâ€”where aesthetics meet logic, crafting seamless and stylish digital spaces where code meets creativity</p>

            </div>

            <div id="dev">
                <h1>Development</h1>
                <p>As much as I love design, I thrive in the world of code. From building sleek, responsive layouts to crafting interactive features, I bring designs to life with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve the performance and functionality of my web projects.</p>

                <h1>My Journey so far</h1>
                <p>In addition to web development, Iâ€™ve started exploring C and C#, though these languages have been more challenging due to their complexity. Iâ€™ve managed to learn the basics, but thereâ€™s still a lot to explore. My resources have been limited, but Iâ€™m committed to pushing through and improving my understanding of these languages.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Iâ€™ve also gained valuable experience as a group leader. I led the development of a Crop Yield Prediction System using machine learning (Random Forest), where I worked on managing large datasets and ensuring data accuracy. I also created UML diagrams and documented software requirements. Another project I led was an e-commerce website for a university group project, where I focused on data structuring and user experience design.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Looking ahead, Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and improving. I want to expand my skills in full-stack development and machine learning, and Iâ€™m always open to exploring new programming languages and technologies.</p>
